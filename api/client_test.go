As with any smartphone, handheld tracking shots can look very jerky, even if you operate it as smoothly as possible and turn on the built-in stabilization. Finally, there's a screw adjustment that moves the phone back and forth so that it's balanced perfectly and pointing ahead, not to the sky or the ground. You can't just point it at your subject and capture glorious tracking shots -- you have to get the hang of using it and develop a light touch on the controls for pans or tilts.  Also, like most handheld stabilizers, the Volt doesn't fix up or down movements, so you have to learn a sort of stealthy, smooth walk. However, the 8-hour battery life is less than you get with other stabilizers, so if you do a marathon session, you'll need to carry spare cells. Once you become proficient , there are more types of moves that you can do than with an electronic gimbal, and it gives you more direct control and feel too.","date_url":"https://d3k9q3t9b6vnz3.cloudfront.net/2018/02/03/dates/en/date.mp3","audio_url":"https://d3k9q3t9b6vnz3.cloudfront.net/2018/02/03/d38cfba3aaad3c1c8d3a211838570a24c1603c96c402ca1100e5e927a514b048/en/9590b5a2-eefc-4106-9de1-79f32c034c3d.mp3","image_url":"https://d3k9q3t9b6vnz3.cloudfront.net/2018/02/03/d38cfba3aaad3c1c8d3a211838570a24c1603c96c402ca1100e5e927a514b048/thumbs/preview.com/images/dims","article_url":"https://www.engadget.com/2018/02/03/steadicam-volt-cinematic-smartphone-stabilizer-gimbal-tiffen-hands-on/","duration":61.074,"filesize_in_bytes":366490,"num_plays":0,"source":"Engadget","source_id":"engadget","guid":"390f1fc1-7d8b-4fa0-80dd-5e0984038e91","published_at":"2018-02-03T16:00:00Z"},{"title":"How to get that pass-through deduction, just like Trump","summary":"If you rent out the entire place for 2 weeks, you can deduct $1,000.

Its global acquisitions included Minnesota-based Carlson Hotels, owner of the Radisson and Park Plaza Hotels; a 25% stake in Hilton Worldwide Holdings; a 9.9% stake in Deutsche Bank; the aircraft leasing arm of the New York financial firm CIT Group; and Ingram Micro, the Irvine-based company that is the world’s largest distributor of technology products.  In January 2017, HNA Capital, one of the group’s subsidiaries, pledged $200 million for a majority stake in SkyBridge Capital, the New York hedge fund of Anthony Scaramucci, facilitating Scaramucci’s colorful, albeit brief, stint as an official in the Trump White House. An unsigned commentary in the Peoples’ Daily, borrowing from metaphors popularized by Nassim Nicholas Taleb and American policy analyst Michele Wucker, argued that China’s acquisitive conglomerates weren’t \"black swans\" but \"gray rhinos\"—high-impact risks that were highly probable but widely ignored.","date_url":"https://d3k9q3t9b6vnz3.cloudfront.net/2018/02/03/dates/en/date.mp3","audio_url":"https://d3k9q3t9b6vnz3.cloudfront.net/2018/02/03/12ccfbf643efe7c2286ff750d0faa5bd8f9b972aa94a60701600e660ac0629e9/en/cc6e504e-c089-42d6-9310-1153eda78bff.mp3","image_url":"https://d3k9q3t9b6vnz3.cloudfront.net/2018/02/03/12ccfbf643efe7c2286ff750d0faa5bd8f9b972aa94a60701600e660ac0629e9/thumbs/preview.jpg","article_url":"http://fortune.com/2018/02/03/chinas-wounded-rhinos/","duration":70.113,"filesize_in_bytes":420721,"num_plays":0,"source":"Fortune","source_id":"fortune","guid":"c385113f-7afe-4cad-a901-c71e18d04668","published_at":"2018-02-03T15:58:09Z"},{"title":"Personal debt: Why now is a critical time to pay off credit cards","summary":"The Federal Reserve said earlier this month that overall consumer borrowing in the U.S. jumped 8.8% in November, the most in more than two years, a sign of growing confidence in the economy.

On a related note, don’t shove the router in a corner of a home, or locked away in a cabinet, because you don’t like the way it looks. If it’s been a few years since you’ve upgraded your router, consider picking up a new one – with 802.11ac speeds instead of the older 802.11n — as it’s not only faster but covers a wider area and supports more simultaneous devices. Those in a larger home might consider a MESH network, which is a more advance router, and includes multiple \"bases\" or \"hubs\" – wireless extenders, if you will — to place around the home.

It has been used in targeted attacks to disable an adversary’s capabilities, such as Stuxnet, where Iran’s ability to enrich weapon-grade Uranium was disrupted. Once considered a legitimate weapon to stifle enemy movement, most countries now agree that landmines are indiscriminate and disproportionate weapons that cause civilian suffering long after a conflict has ended. Researchers, such as my colleague Michael Robinson, have attempted to characterize cyber warfare to understand how it can be effectively and ethically conducted. Protracted UN cyber warfare talks fell apart last year because a consensus couldn’t be reached amid suspicions that reportedly mirrored the Cold War era. The effectiveness of cyber weapons diminishes once the vulnerabilities they have exploited become known, so one approach would be to publish detected cyber weapons to render them obsolete.  Responsible disclosure would allow vendors to come up with fixes and give potential victims a chance to apply the patches – which can be a lengthy process. This approach has a nasty side-effect: it inadvertently leads to a proliferation of cyber weapons, because it’s easier for other nations or criminals to acquire the technology before adequate protections can be put in place on a global scale.","date_url":"https://d3k9q3t9b6vnz3.cloudfront.net/2018/02/03/dates/en/date.mp3","audio_url":"https://d3k9q3t9b6vnz3.cloudfront.net/2018/02/03/b003923f85e27eadcea9a36349fc29ababdfb0db046c42342207e7adad3840f6/en/9cfc4499-68e2-47a7-8451-7b38a4a35415.mp3","image_url":"https://d3k9q3t9b6vnz3.cloudfront.net/2018/02/03/b003923f85e27eadcea9a36349fc29ababdfb0db046c42342207e7adad3840f6/thumbs/preview.png","article_url":"https://thenextweb.com/syndication/2018/02/03/cyber-peacekeeping-forces/","duration":75.546,"filesize_in_bytes":453321,"num_plays":0,"source":"The Next Web","source_id":"the-next-web","guid":"b5b0848d-659a-4b2e-acea-e72fdc448c4a","published_at":"2018-02-03T15:30:42Z"},{"title":"A CEO who gives his employees $2,000 to go on vacation says there are 5 reasons the policy is good business","summary":"Combined with the paid-vacation fund, team members get five extra days off each year — one for each month that doesn't already come with a three-day weekend.

While Trump’s infrastructure plan would prioritize projects that could draw local funding, like increasing tolls, it could be difficult for states to fully fund larger projects that the federal government previously would have heavily subsidized. The large portion of funding for rural areas could address the issue in which investors are hesitant to get involved in major projects in low-trafficked areas—it's often difficult to draw private investors to quieter roads, where there is less infrastructure in which to get involved, and profit margins are slimmer.

That gives him a bloc of at least 50 MPs, not all of whom would vote for him in a leadership contest but enough of whom might to get him to the last two. Within moments, Rees-Mogg was elected – unopposed – as chair of the European Research Group, the main grouping of Brexit true believers in the Commons. In the old days people might have become MPs because they wanted to serve their constituents from the back benches in comfortable obscurity, but not today. Indeed, Rees-Mogg came top of the Conservative Home survey of Tory members this week, albeit with only 21 per cent of responses from a self-selecting sample . \"I am who I am.\" Well, yes, but who are we really? Jeremy Corbyn’s Castro-capped Bennism is not a facade either, and yet it turns out to be remarkably flexible on the question of Brexit. He is genuine, but his opposition to abortion, for example, is something he has said he would never seek to impose by law on others. Thus the people who disrupted his speech at the University of the West of England yesterday might as well have been paid to do so by the Moggmentum campaign.","date_url":"https://d3k9q3t9b6vnz3.cloudfront.net/2018/02/03/dates/en/date.mp3","audio_url":"https://d3k9q3t9b6vnz3.cloudfront.net/2018/02/03/f72520e7cb0e44b1d7d21de4966c3a83b768cbbe138bd467e24e55bd64951604/en/b8baf056-fcdd-4363-ad61-8664555dbcc2.mp3","image_url":"https://d3k9q3t9b6vnz3.cloudfront.net/2018/02/03/f72520e7cb0e44b1d7d21de4966c3a83b768cbbe138bd467e24e55bd64951604/thumbs/preview.jpg","article_url":"http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/jacob-reesmogg-protest-university-bristol-jeremy-corbyn-favourite-bookies-a8192781.html","duration":70.687,"filesize_in_bytes":424169,"num_plays":0,"source":"Independent","source_id":"independent","guid":"54930a4b-0320-42a0-9086-db589d81f765","published_at":"2018-02-03T15:23:09Z"},{"title":"15 hilariously scathing reviews of movies that won the Oscar for best picture","summary":"For some films — like 2015 winner \"Birdman,\" and 2005 winner \"Crash\" — it was hard to choose which horrible review to feature.
